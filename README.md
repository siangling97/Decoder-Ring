# Decoder-Ring

**Live web app:** [https://decoder-ring-mu-ecru.vercel.app/](https://decoder-ring-mu-ecru.vercel.app/)

A project I developed as part of my Thinkful engineering course. I wrote the JavaScript logic for this application, which takes strings as inputs and encodes/decodes them using different encryption methods.

Research for this project was conducted during my Thinkful bootcamp, and it helped solidify my understanding of basic JavaScript and algorithm writing skills.

Created using:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
