# Decoder-Ring

Live web app: https://decoder-ring-two.vercel.app/

A project for my thinkful engineering course I wrote the javascript for. Takes strings as inputs and encodes/decodes them using ddifferent encryption methods.

Reasearch for this project was done through the thinkful bootcamp, and it helped solidify my basic JavaScript / algorithm writing skills. 

Created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that I was learning while putting this project together.
